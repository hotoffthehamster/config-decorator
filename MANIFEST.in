# NOTE: While we do not have to explicitly exclude files (they will not be
# packaged regardless), doing so means we do not have to add the filename
# to the --ignore option in the `check-manifest` call in `tox -e manifest`.
# NOTE: This list ordered like `git ls-files` orders.
# SCM files:
exclude .coveragerc
exclude .editorconfig
exclude .gitignore
exclude .ignore.example
exclude .isort.cfg
exclude .readthedocs.yml
exclude .travis.yml
exclude MANIFEST.in
exclude codecov.yml
